# Data Science Summer Experience

This repository contains the curriculum materials for our Data Science Summer Experience. Curriculum designed and revised by Marlena Duda. Lessons created by Marlena Duda, Kelly Sovacool, Zena Lapp, Logan Walker, and Negar Faranzeh.

The Lessons directory contains live coding demos meant to introduce each topic in ~15 minute interactive mini-lessons. These lessons are delivered in Jupyter Notebooks in a "fill in the blanks" style. Instructors will guide students through each lesson and the students will follow along, filling in the blanks on their own documents as we go.

The Practices directory contains practice exercises for students to spend ~30 minutes to solidify skills taught in each mini-lesson. These practices are delivered in Jupyter Notebooks in a "fill in the blanks" style. Students will work with partners/groups to fill in blanks within the documents, using code from the corresponding lesson as a resource. Instructors will work closely with students to help them complete and understand each practice.

Both Lessons and Practices directories contain Keys subdirectories that contain correctly completed versions of each lesson/practice exercise.
